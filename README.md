# MyFoodMvcApp

MyFoodMvcApp is a simple ASP.NET Core MVC web application designed to demonstrate the use of controllers, models, and JSON responses. The application features a basic TestController that filters a collection of food items based on whether they are halal or not, returning the filtered data in a JSON format.

This project is a good example for understanding how to create controllers, interact with models, and return JSON data in an ASP.NET Core MVC application.
